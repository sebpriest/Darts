## Darts simulation
This repository contains an implementation of a darts match and set simulation model, where two players compete based on their average dart performance statistics. The simulation models each leg and set of a match using a probabilistic approach, with a focus on simulating the number of darts thrown by each player and determining the winner of each set and match.

Key Features:

- Simulates individual darts sets and full matches between two players.
- The winner of each leg is determined by comparing the number of visits (sets of 3 darts) taken to finish 501 points.
- Simulations support customizable configurations for match length (best-of-sets) and set length (best-of-legs).
- Supports multiple match simulations to compute statistical probabilities (e.g., win rates and match outcomes).
- This code is designed for experimenting with various player averages and scenarios and can be expanded for deeper analysis or visualization.
